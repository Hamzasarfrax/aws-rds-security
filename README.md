Production-Ready AWS RDS Security & Threat Detection

In today’s cloud-first world, securing your RDS databases is non-negotiable. Over the past few weeks, I’ve built a production-ready RDS environment with hands-on implementation of industry-standard security, compliance, and monitoring practices.

Here’s what I’ve achieved:
✔ RDS deployed fully private (private subnets, no public access)
✔ Multi-AZ high availability with failover testing
✔ Automated backups + Point-in-Time Recovery + Encrypted snapshots
✔ Cross-region snapshot replication for disaster recovery
✔ CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms for CPU, storage, DB connections
✔ Slow Query Logs, Error Logs, Audit Logs → integrated with CloudWatch
✔ Performance Insights enabled for query-level analysis
✔ AWS Config rules enforced:

rds-instance-public-access-check

rds-storage-encrypted

rds-snapshots-public-prohibited

rds-cluster-multi-az-enabled
✔ GuardDuty RDS protection enabled → EventBridge + SNS alerts for real-time threat detection
✔ Secrets Manager rotation implemented for DB credentials
✔ Event-driven monitoring & automated compliance reporting

Impact / Learnings:

Achieved top-tier RDS security posture with real-time alerting

Ensured continuous compliance & governance for cloud databases

Simulated failover, backups, and DR scenarios to test resilience

Gained hands-on mastery of CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, EventBridge, SNS, and RDS logs

💡 My philosophy: Security is not just configuration—it’s continuous monitoring, alerting, and compliance automation.

I’d love to connect with cloud security professionals and recruiters who are looking for someone who can build, monitor, and secure production-grade cloud databases.
